## What is Revival Group? 🔨

Revival Group is a specialized company focused on Window and Door Installation and Replacement services. They provide high-quality solutions for homeowners looking to enhance their property's aesthetics, energy efficiency, and security.

## Why Did You Build It? 🎯

As part of a core initiative, I developed a comprehensive Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system for Revival Group. This system was designed to streamline their business operations by:

- Recording and tracking leads 📊
- Scheduling appointments efficiently 📅
- Managing customer relationships effectively 🤝

The goal was to improve the company's workflow and provide better service to their clients.

## How Did You Build It? 🛠️

The development process involved several key steps:

1. **Database Management**: Designed and implemented a robust database structure to store all necessary information.
2. **API Creation**: Developed a set of APIs to facilitate communication between the frontend and backend systems.
3. **Admin Panel**: Built a user-friendly admin panel for easy management of data and operations.
4. **Marketing Website**: Created a website to showcase Revival Group's products and services, enhancing their online presence and marketing efforts.

## What Tools Did You Use? 🧰

- **Frontend**: `Bootstrap` 🎨 - For responsive and attractive UI design
- **Backend**: `Laravel` 🐘 - Powering the server-side logic and API
- **Deployment**: `Laravel Forge` 🚀 - For seamless deployment and server management

This project combined modern web technologies with practical business needs, resulting in a powerful tool for Revival Group's operations and growth.
